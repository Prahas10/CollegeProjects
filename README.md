## Email App <a name="Email App"></a>
This project demonstrates basic Object Oriented Programming Paradigms demonstrated through a basic email generator and management implemented solely on **java**.

## Basic Blockchain <a name="Basic Blockchain"></a>
In the two projects SLL_blockchain and merkle_blockchain we have implemented the  basic functioning and concept of blockchain on **java**. We have used different data structures:
- Reversed Singly Linked List
- Merkle tree
We have also tried to implement and demonstrate an end to end supply chain management and authenticator based on blockchain concepts.

## Stock price prediction <a name="Stock price prediction"></a>
Demonstration and comparison of the basic machine learning algorithms, namely:
- K-nearest neighbour
- Support Machine Vectors
- Decision Trees.
These algorithms have been used to compare their accuracy results in predicting a stock price on the given dataset. The necessary **python notebooks** and the data used have been updated.

## CNN for Digit Recognition <a name="CNN for Digit Recognition"></a>
A Convolutional Neural network is built and simulated on **matlab**. The neural network is used to recognise hand written digits with a 95.2% accuracy 

## SRTP <a name="SVD based RTP"></a>
Implementation of SRTP or 'Singular Value Decomposition based Regression Test Prioritisation' **matlab**.
The implementation is based on the research paper 'Prioritization of Regression Tests using Singular Value Decomposition with
Empirical Change Records'. 

## Drug Discovery <a name="Drug Discovery"></a>
In this project, we explore the fascinating field of drug discovery, where science and innovation converge to develop new medicines that improve human health and well-being. 
This directory contains the **python notebook** related to drug discovery tasks, such as data pre-processing, Calculating Lipinski descripters,Chemical space analysis, and data analysis.

## Robotic Welding Arm <a name="Robotic Welding Arm"></a>
This project demonstrates the simple functioning of a welding robot. Simulated on **matlab** using Peter Corke's robotics toolbox for matlab.
The welding arm is able to weld in different variations of welding, including spot welding.
